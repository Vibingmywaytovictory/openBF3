# openBF3

openBF3 is an independent, from-scratch reimplementation of the multiplayer game of Battlefield 3: infantry, bots,
weapons and vehicles, built on Godot 4.8 with all game code in C++ (a GDExtension, no GDScript). It ships no game
content. At runtime it reads the data of your own retail Battlefield 3 install. The project is not affiliated with
or endorsed by Electronic Arts or DICE. The design is in [research/PORTING-RESEARCH.md](research/PORTING-RESEARCH.md);
this tree implements milestone steps S0 (toolchain and skeleton) and M0.1 (install mount, container readers and the EBX
reader in C++).

## The read-as-is rule

* The install (default `C:\Program Files\EA Games\Battlefield 3`) is read in place and never modified. Only
  `bf3_core::InstallReader` resolves install paths. It opens files with `GENERIC_READ` and full sharing, and nothing
  in the code base opens a write handle there.
* Every write target goes through `PathGuard`, which canonicalises the path (8.3 names, casing, `/`, `..`,
  junctions, trailing dots, streams, hard links) and refuses anything under the install root.
* Derived data goes only to `user://bf3cache/`, keyed by content digest. Nothing from the install goes into this repo:
  no dumps, no decoded assets, no partition text. Tests read the install at runtime and assert only numbers.
* The S0 self-test records size and mtime of `Data/layout.toc`, every `cas.cat` and every `.toc`/`.sb` under
  `Data/Win32` and `Update/*/Data/Win32` before and after a session, and fails on any difference.

Install location, first match wins: `--bf3-install=<dir>` (user arg), env `OPENBF3_INSTALL`, project setting
`openbf3/install/path`, then the default path above.

## Prerequisites (Windows x64)

* Visual Studio 2026 (18) with MSVC 19.51+ (the bundled CMake and Ninja work; CMake ≥ 3.25)
* Python 3 (godot-cpp's binding generator), git
* Godot `4.8.dev7.official.c971f93e7` (console and GUI exe). Other builds need an API re-dump (see below).
* A Battlefield 3 install with Update/Patch, needed only to run the game and the install tests

## Clone, build, test

```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url> openBF3
cd openBF3
tools\build.cmd dev            :: = vcvars64 + cmake --preset dev + cmake --build --preset dev + ctest --preset dev
```

From a VS x64 developer prompt the three steps are `cmake --preset dev`, `cmake --build --preset dev` and
`ctest --preset dev`. Presets: `dev` (optimised, godot-cpp `template_debug`, everyday use), `debug` (unoptimised,
`/MTd`), `release` (`template_release`, for shipping) and `asan` (`/fsanitize=address`, libraries, tools and tests
only, no extension DLL). Build trees go to `b\<preset>`. The short path matters:
godot-cpp's generated object paths break MAX_PATH (C1083) under deep roots. The longest object path is 119
characters below the checkout (`b\release\gcpp\...plane_tracking.cpp.obj`), so keep the checkout path under about
140 characters. The extension DLL is written to `bf3-opensource\bin\` (gitignored).

Every target uses the static CRT (`/MT`, or `/MTd` in `debug`) and builds with C++ exceptions off
(`_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=0`). This covers godot-cpp, Jolt, ENet, Recast, libdeflate and doctest.

`ctest` runs `core.guard`, `core.formats` (container and EBX readers on synthetic bytes), `core.install`, `sim.jolt`,
`net.enet` and `host.server`. `core.install` reports *Skipped* when no install is found. With an install it also
reads every bundle manifest of the 53 non-chunk superbundles and checks SHA1s through the CAS, binary, delta and
tail-only paths, and parses every EBX partition of `@all-mp` (50,486) with spot checks of known field values.
`core.fuzz` (also skipped without an install) feeds seeded mutations of real partitions, stored payloads and a
`.toc` (in memory only) through every parser; run it under `ctest --preset asan` after reader changes
(`OPENBF3_FUZZ_ITERS` raises the default 250 mutants per input).

## Run

```bat
set "GODOT=C:\path\to\Godot_v4.8-dev7_win64_console.exe"
:: once per fresh checkout, so Godot registers the extension (.godot\extension_list.cfg):
"%GODOT%" --headless --path bf3-opensource --import
:: S0 self-test, headless: prints a PASS/FAIL table and exits with code 0 (all pass) or 1
"%GODOT%" --headless --path bf3-opensource -- --s0-selftest [--selftest-seconds=5]
:: windowed game (D3D12): server thread + overlay; optional timed screenshot
"%GODOT%" --path bf3-opensource [-- --quit-after=10 --screenshot=C:\temp\s0.png]
:: dedicated server: no scene, no renderer
"%GODOT%" --headless --path bf3-opensource --main-loop DedicatedMainLoop -- --dedicated-seconds=10
```

Known issue: on a project that has never been opened, the first `--import` registers the extension and writes
`extension_list.cfg`, then exits with 0xC0000005 during editor shutdown. Later runs exit 0. Writing a
one-line `.godot\extension_list.cfg` containing `res://openbf3.gdextension` has the same effect. If the extension
is not loaded, the scene runs without `GameSession` and never quits, so scripts should run with a timeout and check
for the `S0 SELFTEST: PASS` line.

## Inspecting the install: bf3dump

`b\dev\tools\bf3dump\bf3dump.exe [--install=<dir>] <command>` reads the install through `bf3_core` only (no Godot).
It writes only to the output path you give, and refuses paths inside the install. Its output is BF3 data, so keep it
out of the repo.

| command | output |
|---|---|
| `list <out.tsv>` | every ebx/res entry, plus the chunk count, of every bundle of every non-chunk, non-Loc superbundle: `superbundle bundle kind name res_type original_size` (1,094,723 lines, byte-identical to the IW4L-based `ebx-dump list` probe) |
| `chunk <sb> <guid>...` | whether the chunk is in the bundle index, its decoded size, its first 48 bytes |
| `reshead <sb> <res>...` | res type, 16-byte meta, decoded size, first 64 bytes |
| `chunks <sb>` | the bundle chunk index: id, sha1, stored size, tail-only flag, range |
| `verify <sb[,sb..]\|@all>` | loads every bundle, checks every stored SHA1 and decodes every ebx/res/chunk |
| `info` | packages, layout, CAS catalogs, superbundle sites |
| `find <sb> <needle>...` | partitions whose lowercase name contains a needle: name, primary type, superbundle, bundle |
| `types <sb> <Type>...` | every instance of the exact types: type, partition, instance GUID |
| `dump <sb> <out_dir> <depth> <follow> <root>...` | one JSON per root: the root partition and the breadth-first closure of referenced partitions whose name contains one of the comma-separated `<follow>` substrings (`*` = all, `-` = none) up to `<depth>`; `fx/` and `sound/` are followed only with `*`; mesh, texture, shader and sound asset partitions are listed but not expanded |
| `ebxload <sb> [--walk]` | parses every partition on all cores and reports counts, failures, bytes and timing; `--walk` also decodes every value |
| `numcheck` | self-check of the JSON number text rules (no install needed) |

For the EBX commands `<sb>` is a superbundle name, a comma-separated list (the first superbundle that holds a
partition wins) or `@all-mp` (every MP/XP level superbundle plus Globals, Weapons, UI and default_settings_Win32).
`find`, `types` and `dump` print the same bytes as the IW4L-based `ebx-dump` probe: JSON keys sorted, base-type fields
first, references as `{"$ref": partition or "internal", "instance", "type"}`, floats as Rust's f32 `Display` text
(shortest round-trip digits, exact ties rounded away from zero) read back as f64 and written like serde_json's zmij
(`2.7849858e+23`, `1e-7`, fixed notation for exponents -5..15). `bf3dump numcheck` (ctest `tools.numtext`) checks
these rules without an install.

## Engine pinning

godot-cpp is built from the API of the exact engine build, not from its bundled JSONs:
`engine-api/4.8.dev7.c971f93e7/` holds `extension_api.json` (`--dump-extension-api`) and
`gdextension_interface.json` (`--dump-gdextension-interface-json`), passed as `GODOTCPP_CUSTOM_API_FILE` and
`GODOTCPP_GDEXTENSION_DIR`. A dev7 DLL loads silently into any 4.8.x, and a changed method hash only fails at its
first call. So on every engine bump (dev → RC → stable): dump both JSONs into a new
`engine-api/<version>.<hash>/` folder, run `<godot> --headless --validate-extension-api <old extension_api.json>`,
point `OPENBF3_ENGINE_API` at the new folder and rebuild from clean.

## Layout and pinned third-party code

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `src/bf3_core` | `InstallReader`, `ReadOnlyFile`, `PathGuard`, install snapshot. Containers ported from IW4L: `Install` (packages, layout, CAS catalogs), `LevelMount` (base, patch and delta bundle merge; ebx/res/chunk index and payloads), DbObject, toc, binary and CAS manifests, block framing, delta bundles. EBX ported from IW4L: `EbxPartition` (read through the partition's own type descriptors, validated in full), values, `EbxDb`, and `EbxLibrary` (partition lookup by name and GUID across mounted superbundles, lazy or bulk-parallel loading). Godot-free |
| `src/bf3_sim` | own Jolt world at a fixed 60 Hz, Recast/Detour link check (Godot-free) |
| `src/bf3_net` | upstream ENet wrapper, loopback ping (Godot-free) |
| `src/bf3_host` | `ServerHost` on its own `std::thread`, `LoopbackClient` (Godot-free) |
| `src/bf3_godot` | the GDExtension: `GameSession`, `DedicatedMainLoop`, S0 self-test (the only Godot code) |
| `tools/bf3dump` | command-line install inspector on `bf3_core` |
| `tests/` | doctest executables run by ctest |
| `bf3-opensource/` | the Godot project (Forward+, D3D12, Jolt); `scenes/main.tscn` is the main scene |

| submodule | pin | licence |
|---|---|---|
| `extern/godot-cpp` | `b051e694` (master, 2026-10-09; includes hot-reload fix `79c37b21`) | MIT |
| `extern/JoltPhysics` | `v5.6.0`, built with `CROSS_PLATFORM_DETERMINISTIC` | MIT |
| `extern/enet` | `v1.3.18` | MIT |
| `extern/recastnavigation` | `v1.6.0` | zlib |
| `extern/doctest` | `v2.5.3` | MIT |
| `extern/libdeflate` | `v1.26` (zlib inflate of payload blocks) | MIT |

Follow-ups: GitHub Actions CI (configure, build, ctest, headless self-test without an install); the Linux build and
its symbol-visibility test for our Jolt next to Godot's.
